# IndependentEngine
Independent Engine is a custom game engine currently in early development. It is designed to be lightweight, modular, and extensible. The engine is built with a focus on performance and flexibility, using C++ and a clean architecture.
Currently, the engine supports Windows only and includes the basic rendering architecture, input handling, and camera control. Future updates will expand platform support and add more core systems such as physics, audio, and scripting.
## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2022 is recommended, Independent Engine has not been tested in other development environments and is focused on Windows builds for now.

You can clone repositore to a local destination by using git command:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/Sh1nePr0/IndependentEngine`

Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!
## The plan
###  More features to come:
- Fast 2D rendering (UI, sprites, etc.)
- Physically-Based 3D rendering (will be expanded later, 2D first)
- Modern rendering pipeline with frame graph-based architecture
- Support for Mac, Linux, IOS, Android:
  - Native rendering support (DirectX, Vulkan, Metal)
- Fully featured viewer and editor
- Fully scripted interaction
- Integrated third-party 2D and 3D physics engine
- Audio System
- Artificial Intelligence
